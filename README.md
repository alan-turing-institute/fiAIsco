# fiAIsco - Help prevent / create an AI fiasco! 

In this game, a playset for Bully Pulpit Games’s Fiasco system, you and your colleagues will imagine
the story of how an organisation or community’s attempt to implement an AI tool goes horribly wrong. 
Perhaps this will help you stop such a thing in real life.

This game was developed as part of the “Educating Engineers for Safe AI” workshop series, funded by the Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s National Institute for Data Science and AI.

## Prerequisites

The core rules for Fiasco can be purchased [here](https://bullypulpitgames.com/products/fiasco), as either a physical or print-and-play digital version. 
You’ll need a copy of those and the cards here to play the game. It’s best played with 3-5 colleagues - and ideally, 
some of those are not yet thinking about the safety and ethical risks of AI deeply enough - they will when they’ve experienced this fiAIsco!

## Playing the game

You’ll use the cards and rules to work through a number of scenes together, in two acts. Fiasco as a ruleset is designed to 
simulate a movie where things go horribly wrong for the participants. For our modern digital world, the settings now
include places like your corporate slack channel, the discussion in a Jira ticket, or a public spat on social media. 
You might need to interpret some of the core cards imaginatively - for example, a card asking you to imagine a permanent
physical injury might be a psychological scar instead.

We recommend the following interpretations of some of the Fiasco engine cards:
- Tilt cards
   - A dangerous animal gets loose: perhaps "A dangerous algorithm gets loose"?
   - An out of control rampage: perhaps "Something gets out of control"?
   - A frantic chase: perhaps an impending crunch period or deadline, or a literal rush to reach a location?
- Aftermath cards
   - We recommend interpreting these loosely / metaphorically e.g. children crying - could be your students, a permanent limp could been caused by having kicked the desk, or represent psychological scarring

## Contributing

At this stage, we are particularly interested in people who would like to playtest the playset. Please download the playset and give us feedback by opening an issue.

Pull requests are also welcome to suggest improvements or changes to the text or cards. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. 

A future release will make the card texts editable markdown - for now we are using Bully Pulpit Games [DIY Playset PDF Creator](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ho89ek6hev79eoj/BPG-DIY-Fiasco-Playset-Creator-v1-20200501.pdf?dl=0).
