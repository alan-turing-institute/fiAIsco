Help prevent an AI fiasco! 

In this game, a playset for Bully Pulpit Games’s Fiasco system, you and your colleagues will imagine
the story of how an organisation or community’s attempt to implement an AI tool goes horribly wrong. 
Perhaps this will help you stop such a thing in real life.

This game was developed as part of the “Educating Engineers for Safe AI” workshop series, funded by the Alan Turing Institute, 
the UK’s National Institute for Data Science and AI.

The core rules for Fiasco can be purchased here, as either a physical or print-and-play digital version. 
You’ll need a copy of those and the cards here to play the game. It’s best played with 3-5 colleagues - and ideally, 
some of those are not yet thinking about the safety and ethical risks of AI deeply enough - they will when they’ve experienced this fiAIsco!

You’ll use the cards and rules to work through a number of scenes together, in two acts. Fiasco as a ruleset is designed to 
simulate a movie where things go horribly wrong for the participants. For our modern digital world, the settings now
include places like your corporate slack channel, the discussion in a Jira ticket, or a public spat on social media. 
You might need to interpret some of the core cards imaginatively - for example, a card asking you to imagine a permanent
physical injury might be a psychological scar instead.
